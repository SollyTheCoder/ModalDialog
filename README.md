# commonSENSE Frontend Developer Code Test

Your task is to create a custom UI component using React / Typescript. You will be assessed on coding style, testability and functionality. The requirements for the UI component are listed below:

* The component is a modal dialog, which can be opened by pressing a button on the main app.
* The modal dialog should contain a close button in the top-right corner.
* The modal dialog should have capacity for a custom title (displayed at the top of the dialog), custom content, and an array of buttons in the bottom of the dialog.
* When the modal is open, any content behind the modal should be disabled with a visual indicator that it is disabled (e.g. a dark overlay).
* The app should be able to independently open and close multiple modal dialogs with different content, titles, buttons etc.

Some things we prefer:

* Use `React.FC` styled components rather than full class components.
* Avoid using existing UI component frameworks such as Material.
* Make use of React Hooks (e.g. `useEffect`) where possible.
* Use CSS frameworks such as `SASS` or `Tailwind`.

Bonus points for:

* Testability - any kind of unit tests are a huge bonus.
* Clean Code - commenting where necessary, well formatted and structured code, minimal nested loops.
